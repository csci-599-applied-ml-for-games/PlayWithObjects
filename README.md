# Object Detection in Game :

Using Tensorflow and OpenCV, detecting objects and trying to play the game with hand movements. The object needs to cross hurdles successfully. The object is moved (left, right, up, down) based on player hand directions (west, east, north, south). Looking forward to even self-place the hurdles using object detection.
